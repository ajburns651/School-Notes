* Overview

This is where I host all of my notes for school. I started this project in my last few months of my junior year and am continuing it through college. The website is built using EMACS org-mode, and org-publish. All of the code is available on my [[https://github.com/ajburns651][Github]] & [[https://github.com/ajburns651/School-Notes][Repository]]

* About Me
I am currently a senior in highschool at La Costa Canyon. I started this project to benefit my peers learning during the covid pandemic. I realized that due to the online format, many students were struggiling to write down notes, and it was hard to recoup information that was missed if the student was absent. I spent a few weeks creating the original version of this website, which has evolved overtime to what it is now. In the future I hope to expand my platform to allow other students to contribute their own notes.

* Planned Website Upgrades
- +Convert to new format, rescript everything+
- +Add ability to use spaces in note names+
- Upgrade CSS template to allow easier navigation on smartphones
- Add Pictures to the website
- Add Class Descriptions and ensure each class has at least one notes page
- Create easier note posting
- Access from anywhere
  - Maybe using something like dynalist or markdown and then converting?
- Allow others to add their own notes via ticket or multipoint platform
