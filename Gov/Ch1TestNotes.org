* Chapter 1 Test Notes:
** Democracy: Rule by the people
*** Direct: rule by the people themselves
*** Indirect/republic: rule by elected representatives
** Democratic theory:
*** Majoritarian: leaders are heavily influenced by the will of the people
*** Elite Politics: minorities dominate policy making
*** Pluralist: many groups compete with each other for control over policy
** Fundamental democratic structures:
*** Federalism, Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances
** Sources of the Constitution:
*** A. British Customs, Magna Carta, English Bill of Rights
*** B. European philosphers, John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Montisseu
*** C. Colonial experiences, power of purse held by elected assembaly
*** D. State constitutions written after Declaration of Independence
** Articles of Confederation:
*** Weak because there was no power to levy tax, no chief exectuive, no national judiciary, no power to regular interstate or foreign commerce, no national curency
*** Leads to annapolis convention of 1786
** Shays Rebellion:
*** showed the neccesity of a stronger national government
** Areas argued about during the convention:
*** Virgina Plan: representation based on population
*** New Jersey Plan: equal representation among states
*** Connecticut (Great) Compromise: a bicamel legislature with a popularly elected house (based on population) and a senate (equal representation) elected by state legislatures
*** 3/5 Compromise: Slaves would count as 3/5 of a person for tax and representation purposes
** Federalists:
*** Who: Tended to be porperty owners, creditors, or merchants
*** Views: Eliets most fit to govern, feared excess of democracy, feared strong central government
*** Leaders: Hamilton, Madison, Washington, Jay
** Anti-Federalists:
*** Who: Tended to be small farmers, shopkeepers, frontiersmen
*** Views: govt be close to people, weak central government, strong state government, mainly argued for a Bill of Rights
** Checks and Balances
*** Restricted one branch from becoming too powerful
*** For example: veto, veto overide, appointment and confirmation, treaty making and ratification, defense funding and commander in chief
** Political Parties:
*** weaken checks and balances, brings people in government together, prevalance of divided gov, ie, pres of one party and a congress of the opposite party
** Amendment 10:
*** Federal gov only has powers listed in the constitution
*** The rest of the powers goes to the states and the people
*** Limits Federal Government Power
** Judicial review:
*** Power of courts to strike down laws of government actions
*** Established in 1803 in Marbury v Madison. Citizens can challenge constitutionality of laws in court by initaing lawsuits
** Plessy v Ferguson:
*** racial separation legal but must be equal facilities
** Board v Brown:
*** Racial segregation is not legal and is uncosntitutional since it is inherently unequal
** Process of Amending:
*** 2/3 vote from both houses of congress (all have been done this way)
*** Constitutional convention as a request of 2/3 of all states (has never occurred)
** Ratification of Amendments:
*** 3/4 of state legislatures (all but 21st amendment)
*** Ratifying conventions in 3/4 of states, resulting in a more democratic way
** Federalism:
*** Constitutional division of power between the national and state governments. Both get their powers from a constitution, not each other
** Reasons for federalism:
*** A. Allows unity, but not uniformity - allows for differences among states
*** B. More suitable for a large nation
*** C. More suitable for heterogenous people - allows for differences
*** D. Encourages Exploration - states can try certain things on their own without it being a nationwide action
*** E. Keeps the government closer to the people. Multiple points of access for citizens
** Cooperative (marble cake) federalism:
*** mingling of responsibilites between state and national gov since 1937
